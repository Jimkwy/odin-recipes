# odin-recipes

> '''The first of my Foundations projects. At this point, I have already finished cs50, cs50w, Khan academy computer science and Khan Academy JavaScript classes.I have chosen to do the foundations course with TOP to refresh my memory and test myself on the fundamentals of web. So far its been fun.'''

# TOP Project 1: Recipes

- overall its a simplistic webpage with only index page branching into the recipes subdir for recipe pages and static subdir for relevant images
